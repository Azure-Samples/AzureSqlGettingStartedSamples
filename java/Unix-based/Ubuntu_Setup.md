# Machine Setup 

In this part of the tutorial, you will install the necessary dependencies to run Java and connect to Azure SQL.

## Install Java

If you already have Java installed on your machine, skip the next two steps. Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) using the following command.

```terminal
  sudo apt-get install default-jre
```

## Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)

```terminal
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
```
## Install Maven

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) can be used to help manage dependencies, build, test and run your Java project.

```terminal
  sudo apt-get install maven
```
Check that you have Maven properly installed by running the following command.

```terminal
mvn -v
```
