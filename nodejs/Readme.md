# Developing applications with NodeJs and Azure SQL 

This repository contains a tutorial that will guide you through the creation of a simple solution using Node.js that will take advantage of Azure SQL. You will learn how to create a database, use the most common packages to connect to it and, finally, you'll see how performance can be improved *a lot* by using Columnstore Indexes.

No matter which is the platform or the OS you are using, you can happily use Azure SQL. As you can see the tutorial is available to be used with:

- [Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/tutorials/node.js/Windows)
- [macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/tutorials/node.js/macOS)
- [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/tutorials/node.js/RHEL)
- [Ubuntu](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/tutorials/node.js/Ubuntu)
